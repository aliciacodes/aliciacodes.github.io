Hello! 

Sorry it's been awhile since I last posted. I have had some really big life events happen in the last few months, but now I am back for good. One of them was starting a full-time job, so I unfortunately cannot post as much as I did before. However, I hope to post two times a week and work to strengthen the community we have on this blog.

Now that I'm back, I will be continuing the Computer Science track on Codecademy and give my own personal review on the program at the end. It may take a few more months to complete, but we'll keep going. I hope you guys will continue to stick with me as we go on this journey through Codecademy together!
