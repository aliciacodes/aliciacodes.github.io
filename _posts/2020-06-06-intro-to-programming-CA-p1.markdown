Welcome to the first day of the Codecademy challenge! Obviously, I'll be starting from the very beginning in the "Introduction to Programming" section. There are two sections syntax and functions. I'll be tackling syntax first.

# An Overview
In this section, I'll be tackling Python syntax.

The syntax section includes a video, a lesson, a quiz, and project. I have uploaded the materials to a public Github repository that is accessible to everyone. 

Let's get started!

# What is the Computer Science Track? 
The program starts with an essential in-depth view of Python. Python is essential for data science, machine learning, and AI. It's also the world's most popular programming language. Throughout the course, Python will be used to learn the fundamentals of computer science. Understanding these foundational concepts will help you master technical interviews and put you on the right track for a career in software development. The course will then progress into data structures once enough Python is introduced. Data structures are tools to solve problems in computer science such as keeping track of the lowest value in a set of data (use heaps). With the data structures, you will be able to build complex algorithms in Python and in other programming languages. The concepts learned will be extensible to other data structures. 

This introduction is somewhat vague and has a lot of technical jargon. I'll break it down as we go. Now that we've finished the video intro to the course, let's dive into the material. 


# A Lesson on Python Syntax
My notes on this are pretty lengthy (over 3,000 words) and include the activities that were presented during the lesson. You can access my notes <a href = "https://github.com/aliciacodes/codecademy-notes/blob/master/computer-science-track/section-1/learn-python-3-syntax.md"> here. </a>
In this section, the material covered involved comments, print() function, strings, variables, errors, integers, floating points, arithmetic operators, modulo, string concatentation, and the += operator.

# The Quiz
The quiz mostly asked basic multiple choice questions such as "How do you combine two strings?". I made my own versions of the question on Anki. In order to access these flashcards, just download the Anki app on your machine and download them from <a href = "https://github.com/aliciacodes/codecademy-notes/blob/master/computer-science-track/section-1/Codecademy-Python-3-Syntax.apkg">here</a>

# The Project
The project utilized string concatenations, arithmetic operations, variable assignments, and strings. All in all, it was a pretty basic project. You can look it over <a href = "https://github.com/aliciacodes/codecademy-notes/blob/master/computer-science-track/section-1/lovely-loveseats.py">here</a>. 

# Alternatives
Pretty much all of this basic information can be learned from the free <a href = "https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python/modules/learn-python-python-syntax-u-6">Python 2 Syntax</a>  and <a href = "https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python/modules/learn-python-strings-and-console-output-u-4">Python 2 Strings and Console Output</a> courses that Codecademy has to offer. The main difference between between the courses is that print function doesn't have parenthesis in Python 2 as it does in Python 3 and comments are defined using `#`. To supplement the quiz, you can use the Anki cards above or take a Python quiz on <a href = "https://www.w3schools.com/quiztest/quiztest.asp?qtest=PYTHON">W3Schools</a>. A good substitute for the project is one I have made specifically for this blog based upon the material covered in this blog post (<a href = "https://github.com/aliciacodes/python-projects/blob/master/geocaching/geocaching.md">link</a>). Don't be afraid to contact me or submit a pull request if you find any errors in the instructions or think you can help improve this project! 

And that's Day 1 of the Computer Science Track. Thanks for joining me today and I hope to see you tomorrow!
