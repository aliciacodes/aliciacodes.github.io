I love to challenge myself. So, I decided to kick off this blog by giving myself a challenge to complete the Computer Science Track on Codecademy. 
In this track, I will be learning

<u1>
    <li>Python</li>
    <li>Git</li>
    <li>Recursion</li>
    <li>Linked Lists</li>
    <li>Stacks</li>
    <li>Queues</li>
    <li>Trees</li>
    <li>Hash Maps</li>
    <li>and much more...</li>

<br>
<br>
    According to the Codecademy website, this track will take about ~200 hours to complete. I realize it is unrealistic for many to take this track (Codecademy costs $240 a year) so I will be offering free alternatives that will give a similar experience. I will also be taking notes 
and giving additional resources to those who want to learn alongside me.

    Starting tomorrow, I will be posting updates daily while I work towards completing this. I hope you will join me!
