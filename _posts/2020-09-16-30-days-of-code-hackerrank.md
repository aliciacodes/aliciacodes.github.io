Today, I'm starting the 30 days of code challenge on Hackerrank! This challenge was created back in early 2016 by Hackerrank in collaboration with Kathryn
Hodge (aka [BlondieBytes](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4DwZ2VXM2KWtzHjVk9M_xg)). I'm going to go through the challenges each day and give a review on how good I think the material is. Full disclosure, I do work professionally as a software engineer so I will not be learning these topics for the first time. However, I have not taken a class that reviews the material in 30 Days of Code in over three years and have not really encountered these topics in my work so it is still a challenge for me.

If you are just learning to code, please follow along! I will be happy to help at every step of the way, just tweet at me ([@aliciacodes1] https://twitter.com/aliciacodes1) if you have any questions. Tomorrow, we'll dive in!
