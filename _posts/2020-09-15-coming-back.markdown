Hello! 

<br/>

Sorry it's been awhile since I last posted. I have had some really big life events happen in the last few months, but now I am back for good. One of them was starting a full-time job, so I unfortunately cannot post as much as I did before. However, I hope to post two times a week and work to strengthen the community we have on this blog.

<br/>

Unfortunately, with this good news I also have some bad news to pair with it. I can no longer continue doing the Codecademy Computer Science track since it is on the Pro version of Codecademy which costs $250 per year. When I initially set out to do this, I was using a free three month trial Codecademy was giving to college students. That trial expired in June and I'm unable to continue paying for it due to my personal financial situation. I hope that one day I can continue it again, be able to give a full review of the track, and continue giving free alternatives to help you learn the same material. 

<br/>

For now, I will introduce a new coding challenge and put the Codecademy one on hold. I will fully introduce it in tomorrow's blog post so stay tuned. Thanks guys!
