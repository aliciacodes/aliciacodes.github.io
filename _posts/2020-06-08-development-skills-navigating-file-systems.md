Welcome to day 3! Today, I'm moving onto the Development Skills module which consists of "Navigating the File System" and "Basic Git Workflow". We'll be focusing on navigating directories and files through the command line. 

In this section, there is one lesson, two projects, a quiz, and an article.

# Navigation Lesson
This lessons was all about learning about learning more about the command line and filesystem. My in-depth notes on that are <a href = "https://github.com/aliciacodes/codecademy-notes/blob/master/computer-science-track/section-3/Navigating-The-File-System.md">here</a>. This lesson was all about the command line, filesystem, and some common commands used to peruse it.

<ul>
<li> The command line is a text-based program that takes commands and gives it to the computer program to run. The command line can run programs, scripts, and do hard tasks by combining commands. </li>

<li>The filesystem organizes the computer's files and directories into  a tree structure. The parent directory of all directories is the root and all other directories have a parent based on directory above them.</li>

<li>The command line is run through an application called the Terminal on Mac and Linux which are unix-based environments. The `$` sign in the terminal is called the shell prompt and appears when the terminal can take a command </li>

</ul>

<ul> The Commands
<li> ls - lists the files and folders (directories) inside it. </li>
<li> pwd - printing working directory or the current directory you are in </li>
<li> cd - change directory. For this command, you can give a directory name (this is called argument). To move up one directory, you can give the argument '..'.</li>
<li>mkdir - Make directory. Mkdir needs the new directory name as an argument which creates a new directory in the current working directory.</li>
<li>touch - Touch creates a new empty file inside working directory and also needs an argument for the new file. </li>
</ul>

# The Projects
The projects focused on using these commands and these concepts. The projects are <a href = "https://github.com/aliciacodes/codecademy-notes/blob/master/computer-science-track/section-3/bicycle-world-ii">here</a> and <a href = "https://github.com/aliciacodes/codecademy-notes/blob/master/computer-science-track/section-3/daily-buzz">here</a>. 

# The Quiz
While taking the quiz I used this amazing resource from github to help me and it has a quiz that comes alongside it. Would definitely recommend it to anyone learning the command line. Here's the <a href = "https://flashcards.github.io/command_line/introduction.html">cheatsheet!</a>

# The Article
The article is a setup guide for Git and the command line available for free on the Codecademy blog. I'm not going to sum it up here as I think this is a pretty good guide. Here's the <a href = https://www.codecademy.com/articles/command-line-setup>link.</a>


# Alternatives
Udacity has a course called Linux Command Line Basics which is based upon unix-like systems. It has interactive quizzes and gives you the basics you need. Check that out <a href = "https://www.udacity.com/course/linux-command-line-basics--ud595">here.</a> There is also the <a href = "https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/command-line-basics-web-development-101">Odin Project Command Line Basics</a> which has many resources for beginners to learn.

That's a wrap on day three. See you tomorrow where we'll be learning about Git!
